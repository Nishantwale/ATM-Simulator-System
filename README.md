## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login using a PIN.
- **Account Management**: Users can check their balance, deposit funds, and withdraw cash.
- **Transaction History**: A log of all transactions is maintained for each user.
- **File-Based Storage**: Account data and transaction history are saved to a file, so they are not lost when the program exits.
