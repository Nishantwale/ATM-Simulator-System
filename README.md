## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later**
- An **SQL database** (e.g., MySQL)
- The **JDBC driver** for your specific database (e.g., `mysql-connector-java.jar`).

### Instructions

1.  **Set up the Database**:
    - Create a database and tables for `accounts` and `transactions`.
    - Example SQL for an `accounts` table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE accounts (
          account_number VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
          pin_number VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
          balance DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
      );
      ```

2.  **Configure the Project**:
    - Add the **JDBC driver JAR file** to your project's build path.
    - Update the **database connection details** (URL, username, password) in your database connection class.

3.  **Run the Application**:
    - Compile and run the main class from your IDE (e.g., `Main.java` or `ATMApp.java`).
